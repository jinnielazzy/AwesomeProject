## I wanted to heal people who got hurt

For emotionally damaged people especially from a romantic relationship, how they handle it varies from person to person. Somehow they would need to decompress by releasing their stories or emotions, and some of them might talk to their friends or relatives. However, as we live in a fast-paced society, it might not be a good idea to frequently keep their friends around. I hope to have this app that allows those people to feel free to throw their SHIT to it as much as they want and have their SHIT heard by others. People with similar SHIT could share and shit on it, hoping they all move on soon. I don’t expect there could be solutions to each SHIT, but instead, there’s always someone to be with them, helping and accompanying them.

- Users would write SHIT to a note put it into a drifting bottle and decide whether or not they need other users to respond to help them through.
- Users can pick drifting bottles and see if they can offer their help or thoughts by starting a private chat with this drifting bottle author. Or they could just throw it back into the “Ocean”.
- All users are anonymous and can register as normal users through authentication or a guest user.
- Drifting bottles that need listeners would always be heard.
- Bottles can technically be seen/picked unlimitedly even when it has been picked.
- Each drifting bottle can have multiple chat sessions and each session is private from the other.
- Users can retrieve the bottles they threw and it would be archived. Also, bottles can be deleted by users.
- Users should be able to keep SHIT private, do not show actual info.
- Users could throw the bottles they collected back to the ocean.
- More coming up
